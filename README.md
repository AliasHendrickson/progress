### **Project Description**

We want to make a progressive web app that would help users keep track, edit,
create, and rate goals.  The user is able to register, login, and logout of an account.  They can see their current goals, stats, level, and view past goals.  The user will be able to attach evidence to a goal, complete goals, and schedule reminders.
